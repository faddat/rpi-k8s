# LED Control

echo 1 >/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness
echo 0 >/sys/class/leds/led0/brightness
# Setting the brightness to 0 automatically sets the trigger to "none"

# Go back to default function:
echo mmc0 >/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

# As an aside, there are a couple of kernel modules you can load up (ledtrig_timer and ledtrig_heartbeat) which will flash the LED for you.

modprobe ledtrig_heartbeat && echo heartbeat >/sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
